#Create a function that takes three number arguments â€” one number as an input and two additional numbers 
# representing the endpoints of a closed range and return the number limited to this range.

#If the number falls within the range, the number should be returned.

#If the number is less than the lower limit of the range, the lower limit should be returned.

#If the number is greater than the upper limit of the range, the upper limit should be returned.
